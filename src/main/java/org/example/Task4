Task 4. Starvation

For starvation problem, it means that there is a possibility for one process to be scheduled infinitely.
To solve this problem, I import the class of ReetrantLock. Since ReentrantLock has newCondition
to allow user to get wait/notify semantics with a fair lock.
This condition is fair, notify wakes threads in FIFO order.
